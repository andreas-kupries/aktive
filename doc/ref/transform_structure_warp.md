## Operators

---
### <a name='op_warp_bicubic'></a> aktive op warp bicubic

Syntax: __aktive op warp bicubic__ src0 src1

Returns an image generated by the application of the origin map (`src0`) to the image (`src1`), with bicubic interpolation.

The result has the domain of the origin map, and the depth of the image.

See [aktive transform affine](generator_virtual_warp.md#transform_affine) and its relatives for a set of operations creating origin maps acceptable here.


---
### <a name='op_warp_bilinear'></a> aktive op warp bilinear

Syntax: __aktive op warp bilinear__ src0 src1

Returns an image generated by the application of the origin map (`src0`) to the image (`src1`), with bilinear interpolation.

The result has the domain of the origin map, and the depth of the image.

See [aktive transform affine](generator_virtual_warp.md#transform_affine) and its relatives for a set of operations creating origin maps acceptable here.


---
### <a name='op_warp_lanczos'></a> aktive op warp lanczos

Syntax: __aktive op warp lanczos__ src0 src1

Returns an image generated by the application of the origin map (`src0`) to the image (`src1`), with order-3 lanczos interpolation.

The result has the domain of the origin map, and the depth of the image.

See [aktive transform affine](generator_virtual_warp.md#transform_affine) and its relatives for a set of operations creating origin maps acceptable here.


---
### <a name='op_warp_near_neighbour'></a> aktive op warp near-neighbour

Syntax: __aktive op warp near-neighbour__ src0 src1

Returns an image generated by the application of the origin map (`src0`) to the image (`src1`), with nearest neighbour interpolation.

The result has the domain of the origin map, and the depth of the image.

See [aktive transform affine](generator_virtual_warp.md#transform_affine) and its relatives for a set of operations creating origin maps acceptable here.
