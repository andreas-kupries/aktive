AKTIVE's documentation directed at its users is mostly organized around the 4 quadrants, i.e.

|		|Studying						|Working				|
|:---		|:---							|:---					|
|Practical	|[Tutorials](tutorials.md) (to learn)			|[How To](howtos.md) (solve problems)	|
|Theoretical	|[Explanations](explanations.md) (for understanding)	|[Reference](ref/index.md) (information)|
  
Not all of the quadrants are filled at the moment.

The only quadrant actually ensured to contain documents at the moment is the reference information,
as that part is generated from the operator specifications.
