# Materialization

In the strict sense any operator which makes the entire image available somewhere.

This would therefore include all the operators saving an image into a file on disk.

Here we consider only operators placing the image entirely into memory as such.

This is a much smaller set.

By necessity such operators are [strict](strictness.md) in their input.
However not all strict operators materialize the image.

An __index of materializing operators__ does not exist (yet).
